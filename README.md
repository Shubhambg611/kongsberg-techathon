<b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b>
MANY CORPORATE OFFICES CONSUME A LOT OF ELECTRICITY DAILY TO POWER EVERYTHING FROM LIGHTS TO COMPUTERS. HOWEVER, NOT ALL OF THIS ENERGY IS USED EFFICIENTLY, WHICH LEADS TO UNNECESSARY WASTE AND HIGHER COSTS. IN TODAY’S WORLD, WHERE SUSTAINABILITY IS CRUCIAL, REDUCING THIS WASTED ENERGY IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR CUTTING COSTS, BUT ALSO FOR HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT. 

THE PROBLEM WE’RE ADDRESSING IS THAT OFFICE BUILDINGS OFTEN DON’T HAVE A CLEAR WAY TO PREDICT THEIR FUTURE ENERGY NEEDS OR KNOW HOW TO OPTIMIZE THEIR ENERGY USAGE. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY MIGHT  LEAVE LIGHTS ON IN EMPTY ROOMS OR USE HEATING AND COOLING SYSTEMS WHEN THEY’RE NOT NEEDED, LEADING TO WASTED POWER.
